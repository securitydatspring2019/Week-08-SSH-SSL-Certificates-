# THIS IS NOT YET READY FOR SPRING 2019 - WILL CHANGE A LOT
# Week-08-SSH-SSL-Certificates
Cryptograhy, Certificates, Digital Signatures, Man-in-the-middle and more

_This is going to be a pretty heavy week when it comes to theory. Most of the exercises will not involve code, but steps necessary to understand and USE the terms below, and see how they are all required to get a secure connection in a browser_
- SSH and SSH Tunnels
- Symmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric Encryption
- Hashing and Hash Digests
- Digital Signatures
- Certificates
- Certificate Authorities and Certificate Trust Hierarchies
- :red_circle: MAC (Message Authentication Code)
- :red_circle: Cipher Suites

## What to Install

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) if not already done. If you have installed Kali Linux, just continue with the version available here.

#### WireShark SSL-handshake sample we did in the class
[wireshark-sample (TBD)](#)
      
## Wednesday March 20 th.

## Thuersday March 21 th.

### What to Read or Watch :information_source:
- [:tv: Introduction to Cryptographic Keys and Certificates (18. min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9vu6_2r0o4)
- [:tv: What are certificates (15 min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMBZhdFjDI&t=264s) (Covers more or less the same topics as the next video, I do however recomment both)
- [:tv: What is PIK (watch the first 8 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqgYSXWYQM&t=170s)

- :full_moon: [:book: Cryptographic hash function (5-10. min Skim only)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)
- :red_circle: [:book:Cipher Suites (6 min. skim only so you know what it is conceptually)](https://www.jscape.com/blog/cipher-suites) neccesary to understand parts of the Wireshark demo
